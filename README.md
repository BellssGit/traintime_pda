# Whatever I want to write

Xidian Directory: Functional, but need to add report function.  
(now pending since data is too old and nobody update it, maybe when I finish the whole).   
Sport Punch Record / Sport Score: Functional, but I need to write a cache-like things.
IDS related: Trouble with the implementation of web code.  
Classtable Window: Found one on the Internet. When IDS completed.
